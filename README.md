# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math module
### Step 2: 
give the two coordinates for finding distance
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
use the inbuilt sqrt function to find the distance
### Step 5: 
print the value of distance
### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
p1=[10,6]
p2=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt((p1[0]-p2[0])**2+(p1[1]-p2[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))

```


### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
thus the program to find the distance between two points exicuted successfully
